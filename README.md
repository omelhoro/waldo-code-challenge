# Waldo Code Challenge

## Start

First you'll the parcel bundler globally then it should be pretty straightforward

```
npm i -g parcel-bundler
npm i # should be executed in this root dir of this repo
npm run dev
```

The app should be now available on http://localhost:1234

## Techs

The technologies were chosen according to the scope of the task:

- React
- Hooks for state management
- Axios (doing graphql queries)
- Semantic UI for providing the styling
- Parcel for easiness of the setup

More complicated solutions with Apollo or Redux weren\'t used because I didn't want to over engineer this app, but certainly I'm convinced of this libraries and would use them in a more complex setting
